## Class Information



This is an **experimental** class - the combination of topics is almost novel and the treatment is novel. Please expect some messiness! üòÖ

<br>

I have three objectives for this class:
* Prepare you for the socio-technical challenges of a data science job - or at least make you aware about them.
* Get **us** out of our "hard sciences" comfort zone - some of the issues behind AI algorithms need to be understood with tools beyond performance metrics.
* Foster discussion and a nuanced understanding about the societal impacts of AI.

---

## What is Trustworthy AI?

![bg left](img/dalle_lady.png)

<br>
<br>

The study of how AI techniques, methodologies and applications may be made **reliable**, **dependable** and **aligned with human values**.

## What is Trustworthy AI



An AI system may be understood as the sum of its parts:

* **Data**, as the input "experience" which needs to be taken into account - this does not need to be **big** data. 
* **Algorithms**, as the means to process the above data so to obtain 
* **Decisions** which we may employ directly or use as assistance for our own.


---

## What is Trustworthy AI



Simple example: the **thermostat** [Russell and Norvig, Chapter 1]

* **Data**: your choice of desired temperature for your rooms and water, possibly depending on the time of day / year; the current temperature 
* **Algorithm**: if the current temperature is lower than desired: activate. If it is higher: deactivate.
* **Decisions**: whether to activate the heating system or not.


How do we know if this system is **trustworthy**, i.e. reliable and dependable?

---

## What is Trustworthy AI


We should be able to agree that the thermostat is trustworthy when it makes **a limited amount of mistakes**, that is, it follows our instructions closely and timely. 

<br>

Possible measure of **success**: not getting a huge energy bill at the end of the year.

<br>

---

## What is Trustworthy AI

<br>


Complicated example: **selecting people for a finance job interview**

**Data**, **algorithm**, **measure of success**: any suggestions?

---

## What is Trustworthy AI


Some ideas:

* A quantitative background
* Some classes on stochastics 
* Nice portfolio of projects / internships
* Good grades
* Degree obtained in a very good/competitive school


Many more are possible. Is it simple to **explicitly enumerate all the requirements**, and come up with a procedure to compute a **yes/no** decision?

---

## Clinical vs. Actuarial Judgement


<br>

>In the **clinical method** the decision-maker combines or processes information in his or her head. In the **actuarial** or **statistical method** the human judge is eliminated and conclusions rest solely on empirically established relations between data and the condition or event of interest."

Dawes, Faust and Meehl, 1989. *Science*. Emphasis mine.

---

## Clinical vs. Actuarial Judgement

<br>
<br>


A "**clinical AI method**" relies on a set of pre-determined rules, given by a domain expert.

<br>

An "**actuarial/statistical AI method**" looks at **past data** to **predict future outcomes**. 

---


## Clinical vs. Actuarial Judgement

One possible way to look at the history of AI is to divide it into two phases:

* Logic/Knowledge-baseed approaches: gather knowledge, manipulate symbols in a logical sound way - **clinical judgement systems**. 1956 ~ 1990.
* Data-based approaches: gather data, use statistics to find optimal decisions - **actuarial judgement systems**. 1980 ~ now

This is **not** the full picture, of course. 


---


## Clinical Judgement in AI

**Expert systems** have been an incredibly successful application of AI - if enough knowledge is gathered, one can build a chain of if-else rules which offer good performance for a given task. 

Example applications:

* Medical diagnosis - gather symptoms, suggest disease and treatment
* Chip design - collect requirements, suggest design
* Space shuttle mission control - Muratore et al., 1989

## Clinical vs. Actuarial Judgement in AI

<br>
<br>


AI researchers found it **impossible** to solve this problem via clinical judgement, i.e. a full enumeration of what a "baby", "lego brick" is under all possible circumstances.

Imagine even trying! If a certain group of pixels is pink... well, not necessarily pink... and if two groups of pixels contain another group which is circular... then you have a face?

This may seem reasonable to us now, but it was relatively surprising after the first few successes of clinical-style AI.

## Actuarial Judgement in AI

<br>


> The primary goal of the project is to construct a system of programs which will divide a vidisector picture into regions such as likely objects, likely background areas and chaos. [...] The final goal is OBJECT IDENTIFICATION which will actually name objects by matching them with a vocabulary of known objects.

<br><br>

It would take us ~45 years to get acceptable results. 


---

## Actuarial Judgement in AI


<br>

What happened in the meantime?

* **Machine learning** techniques - "actuarial AI" - made huge theoretical and technological progress.
* More and more researchers realized the importance of **developing massive datasets** from which actuarial judgement techniques can show their power.

## Actuarial Judgement in AI

<br>


Nowadays, machine learning models are hosted on your phone and may create galleries for you: family, friends, pets, trip to London, etc. This was enabled by the creation of **1M+ image databases** (e.g. ILSVRC). 

Voice-based assistants are also "powered by ML". Speech-to-text models require **thousands of hours** of audio data (e.g. PeopleSpeech).

Of course, hard to imagine this happening without the Internet.

## Actuarial Judgement in AI

<br>


Of course, the resurgence (2010s) of **deep learning** techniques - i.e. neural networks - played no small part in this.

Compared to other **actuarial** methodologies which explicitly represent and manipulate probability distributions (Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models, Bayesian Networks...), they show a higher capacity to **scale to massive amounts of data**. 

The reasons why this is true are well beyond the scope of this class, and we will treat it as an experimental fact.

## How does this happen?



**Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination.**  Bertrand and Mullainathan. 2003

<br>

>We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: **White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews**. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase.

## US only?



**Ethnic Discrimination in Germany‚Äôs Labour Market: A Field Experiment.** Kaas and Manger, 2010. 

<br>

>To each of 528 advertisements for student internships we send two similar applications, one with a Turkish-sounding and one with a German-sounding name. **A German name raises the average probability of a callback by about 14 percent.** Differential treatment is particularly strong and significant at smaller firms at which the applicant with the German name receives 24 percent more callbacks. Discrimination disappears when we restrict our sample to applications including reference letters which contain favourable information about the candidate‚Äôs personality.

<br>

Actuarial AI is often **opaque**, meaning that it is difficult / impossible to understand **why** a certain AI system has made a particular decision

While it is possible to **inspect** a model's parameters (its **algorithm**), connecting it to the actual decisions is another matter entirely

This is especially true for deep neural networks

<br>


"**‚ÄòIt Happened So Fast‚Äô: Inside a Fatal Tesla Autopilot Accident**" NY Times. 2019


>Neither he nor Autopilot noticed that the road was ending and the Model S drove past a stop sign and a flashing red light. The car smashed into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe, killing a 22-year-old college student [...] the accident report and court filings paint a tragic picture of overreliance on technology. They also strongly suggest that Autopilot failed at a basic function ‚Äî automatic emergency braking ‚Äî that engineers developed years ago.

**How do you debug this**?

## Trustworthy AI

<br>


The aim of this class is to prepare you for the **real-world requirements** of AI development, and, above all, **real-world deployment**

It is relatively easy to write code; maintaining it is the hard part

The same holds for AI systems -- how do we ensure that nothing goes wrong? Or, how do we respond when something does go wrong?

---

## Trustworthy AI


While some of the possible situations are unique to certain application fields, here we focus on three (/four) dimensionalities:

* **Fairness**: ensuring that our models **do not discriminate** against certain groups of people
* **Interpretability**: ensuring that we can **make sense** of our models' decisions
* **Privacy**: ensuring that our analysis does not infringe people's **privacy rights**
* **Lawfulness**: ensuring that we are able to **refer to the relevant legislation** during our future work in AI development

---

## Trustworthy AI


We will often borrow from **recent research** and **developments** on this topic, and discussion is always encouraged.

<br>

The common theme: once an AI system is deployed to act in society, many issues and "bugs" may become **socio-technical**, not only technical.

<br>

## Next lecture - Data and Measurement

* What is **data**? 
* What is **raw data**?
* What does it mean to **collect data**?
* Is it possible to **remove the human judge** from the actuarial AI process?
